## Getting started

You can generate a brickr mosaic object from an image using `brickr::image_to_mosaic()`. Pass this object to `build_mosaic()` to construct a visualization of the mosaic.

![](../Images/mf_unicorn.PNG){ width='250px' }

```{r g1}
mosaic <- png::readPNG("../Images/mf_unicorn.PNG") %>% 
  image_to_mosaic()

mosaic %>% build_mosaic()
```

The default is to create a mosaic with 48 knobs (brick studs) on each side. Change this using the `img_size` input. A single value will create a square mosaic, while an array of two values represent the width and length.

```{r g2}
png::readPNG("../Images/mf_unicorn.PNG") %>% 
  image_to_mosaic(img_size = 32) %>% 
  build_mosaic()
```

## Colors

A key feature in `image_to_mosaic()` is the conversion of the original image into colors produced by LEGO. The default is to map each individual pixel to any of the 41 flat colors currently used for brick production using the [CIE94](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIE94) algorithm. These defaults can be changed.

### Color palettes

There are currently 2 main ways to control the color palettes to build mosaics in brickr. 

  - The `color_palette` input takes a list of pre-defined palettes to create the mosaic.
  - The `color_table` input can take a data frame of specific colors. Usually a subset of the included `lego_colors` table.

#### Default color palettes

Each of the 41 colors belongs to one of three categories:

  - 'universal' colors are the most common. This list includes white/black/grays/brown and the classic yellow, red, blue, and green colors. All brick sizes should be readily available in these colors.
  - 'generic' colors are commonly used in LEGO products, though it might be more difficult to find every brick in these colors.
  - 'special' colors are typically reserved for certain products and it's likely that bricks might not be actively produced in these colors.
  
Use the `color_palette` input in the `image_to_mosaic()` function to limit the bricks used to any combination of these three categories.

```{r c_palettes, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
p1 <- png::readPNG("../Images/mf_unicorn.PNG") %>% 
  image_to_mosaic(32, color_palette = c('universal', 'generic')) %>% 
  build_mosaic(title = "universal & generic")

p2 <- png::readPNG("../Images/mf_unicorn.PNG") %>% 
  image_to_mosaic(32, color_palette = c('universal')) %>% 
  build_mosaic(title = "universal")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, layout_matrix = matrix(c(1,2), ncol=2))

```

#### Grayscale

For grayscale or black and white mosaics, use `color_palette = 'bw'`. This creates the mosaic by measuring the brightness of each pixel in the image and mapping it one of the four shades of gray. Use the contrast input to adjust the relative brightness of the pixels.

```{r c_bw}
png::readPNG("../Images/mf_unicorn.PNG") %>% 
  image_to_mosaic(32, color_palette = 'bw', contrast = 1.1)%>% 
  build_mosaic()
```

#### Custom color palettes

With the `color_table` input, it is possible to restrict the colors in the mosaic to a custom palette. 

```{r c_custom}
#Remove blue and azure colors from lego_colors
lego_colors_wo_blue <- lego_colors %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!grepl("blue|azur", tolower(Color)))

png::readPNG("../Images/mf_unicorn.PNG") %>% 
  image_to_mosaic(32, color_table = lego_colors_wo_blue)%>% 
  build_mosaic(title = "Mosaic without blue or azur")
```

### Color matching

brickr uses the [`farver`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/farver/index.html) package to match image colors to the subset of LEGO colors. Technical details of the different algorithms can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference).

The default algorithm is 'cie94', though the other farver options are available using the `method` input. The farver 'euclidean' is not very accurate, so 'brickr_classic' returns a manually calculated version for Euclidean RGB distance matching.

```{r c_methods, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
c("cie94", "cie2000", "euclidean", "brickr_classic") %>% 
  purrr::map(~png::readPNG("../Images/mf_unicorn.PNG") %>% 
  image_to_mosaic(24, method =.x) %>% 
  build_mosaic(title = .x )) -> mosaics_by_method

gridExtra::grid.arrange(grobs = mosaics_by_method, layout_matrix =rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4)))

```

### Dithering

When rendering a mosaic from a photographic with many shades of similar colors, using [dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering) by setting `dithering = TRUE` will help to add texture to the mosaic and avoid large areas of the same color. This works particularly well for large mosaics, but is purely a stylist preference.

```{r c_dither, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
c(FALSE, TRUE) %>% 
  purrr::map(~jpeg::readJPEG("../Images/goldengirls.JPG") %>% 
  image_to_mosaic(dithering = .x) %>% 
  build_mosaic(title = paste("dithering =", .x))) -> mosaics_by_dither

gridExtra::grid.arrange(grobs = mosaics_by_dither, layout_matrix = matrix(c(1,2), ncol=2))
```

### Other color options

The input `brightness` can be used to scale up or down the RGB values of the image before color matching. The default is 1.

## 3D Mosaics

With [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) installed, passing the mosaic object to `bricks_from_mosaic()` will render a 3D object, stacking layers of bricks on each other to create an elevated mosaic. By default, the lightest color bricks will be on top, but this can be changed using the `highest_el = 'dark'` option.

```{r c_threed}
png::readPNG("../Images/mf_unicorn.PNG") %>% 
  image_to_mosaic(32) %>% 
  bricks_from_mosaic(highest_el = "dark") %>% 
  build_bricks(brick_type = "plate")

rayshader::render_camera(theta = 15)
rayshader::render_snapshot(clear = TRUE)
```
